                <p >I learned this week that during the time that Walt Disney was building his empire, copyright law allowed for only 30 years of copyright. This way Walt Disney and others were able remix old stories and create wonderful movies and revamped stories. Copyright law now protects a creator’s work for 70 years after their death (Lessig, 2015). This makes it much more hard for people to build on the creativity of others,  thus putting creators in handcuffs. Open Education Resources would benefit from having a more free society, where educators good more easily build upon the educational creations of others. </p>
                <p>An excludable good is one that is only available to paying customers, like a bicycle. A semi excludable good is one that can sometimes be accessed by non-paying customers, like a lesson plan on teachers-pay-teachers. A non-excludable good is one that anyone can use even if they don’t pay for it, like a road (Wikimedia, 2022). </p>
                <p>Open Education Resources are non-excludable and basically public goods. Historically, the amount of public goods produced has not been sufficient to support demand unless they are subsdized. I think OER can be funded by government programs but possibly even more powerfully by donors and individual efforts of educators who want to make the world a better place. </p>

                <p >I enjoyed reading from two chapters in the book The Public Domain Enclosing The Commons of The Mind (Boyle, 2013). It was intriguing to learn about the limitations of public domain. Specifically the rule that you must wait for 70 years until someone is dead to have their works put into the public domain.  This is long enough of a time period that many sources (often due to the fact that the creator is unknown) are unusable for 70 years or more. </p>
                <p>This is a fault that could be remedied by allowing the amount of time for automatic copyright to be shorter. In the book, Boyle suggests that 28 years of automatic copyright would be sufficient. The creator could then apply for another 28 years if they thought it would benefit them (Boyle, 2013). I am not sure if 28 is the magic number. It might be. I do agree that 70 years after the death of the creator is a little extreme. </p>
                <p>Lastly, I thought Dr. Cable Green made an important point that as creators of educational materials that we make a responsible choice of which creative license we assign to our work (Green, 2017). I agree that I should generally avoid the no derivative licesnse as this limits the openness of the resources I create. </p>

                <p >I was excited to learn that we got to learn about open source software. I completed a web development bootcamp a few months ago and my instructors encouraged me to contribute to open source projects in order to better practice my web development skills. I have been nervous to do so and had not taken the time to learn about open source until I read the assigned readings for my IP&T 521 class. The readings offered more clarity on what open source software actually is. The reading from opensource.org was specifically useful when it indicated that open source software must allow for free redistrubution, provide the source code, and allow for modified works (The Open Source Definition). </p>
                <p>I did not recognize most of the open source software that was mentioned in the different articles. Linux was the resource that I recognized and I know that it has had a large impact in the world of computer science.  I was curious what open-source softwares exist today and with the help of google I realized that React, a web development library, is actually considered open-source software. The frontend web library, React, was actually developed by the company Facebook and is what is used to develop Facebook, Instragram and many other online applications. The software was then released as an open-source resource in May of 2013 (Wikipedia). React is now used by many companies and many different people outside of Meta can contribute to its growth. This seems to be an open-source success story. </p>
                <p>Spending time learning about open-source resources has relit my desire to contribute to open source projects. My web development skills are pretty shabby, but I found a useful blog, called <a href="https://www.firsttimersonly.com/" target="_blank" id="specialA"> First Timers Only</a>, that helps beginner web developers learn how to successfully contribute to open-source projects. I will hopefully attempt to make some small contribution to a project in the future.
